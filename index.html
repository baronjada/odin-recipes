        <li>1 tsp (5 mL) Salt (to taste)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Season chicken with salt, black pepper, sugar, garlic and escallion
          (green onion). Marinate the chicken overnight or for at least one hour
          before frying.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove escallion and garlic from chicken and, on High heat, fry the
          chicken in cooking oil for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until browned.
          Remove chicken from pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove half the remaining cooking oil from the pan then fry chopped
          onion and bell peppers until onions are transparent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add thyme, hot pepper sauce, tomato ketchup and 1 cup of hot water to
          pan and stir; taste gravy and add 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt, if needed; let
          simmer for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add chicken to gravy. Add ½ (125 mL) to 1 cup (250 ml) of hot water
          and turn heat to Low and cover pan. Simmer chicken for 30 minutes or
          until it is tender and the gravy has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
          **If the gravy is still watery after 30 minutes, remove the chicken
          and let the gravy simmer on Medium until it thickens. Then put the
          chicken back in the pan, spoon the gravy over it and simmer for a few
          minutes to warm through.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Notes/Serving Suggestion</h2>
      <p>
        Serve chicken with steamed rice and vegetables or a green salad, and
        fried plantains.
